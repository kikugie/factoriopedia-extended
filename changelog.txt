Version: 0.2.0
Date: 26.11.2024
  Features:
    - Added simulation for roboport.
    - Added simulations for transport belts.
    - Added simulations for underground belts.
    - Added simulations for splitters.
  Scripting:
    - Added `environment.viewport_width(tiles)`.
      Works similarly to `environment.viewport_height(tiles)`, but instead ensures the viewport has the given tiles in width.
    - Added `environment.create_linked_belts(surface, pos1, pos2, direction)`.
      Creates two incredibly fast linked belts, which can be used with any belt type.
    - Added optional second argument to `EventSequence.finish(length, offset)`.
      Delays the execution of the event sequence.
