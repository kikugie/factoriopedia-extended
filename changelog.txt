Version: 0.2.0
Date: 06.12.2024
  Changes:
    - Added fuelling simulations for burner inserters and mining drills.
    - Made splitter simulation more interesting to look at.
    - Improved ore distribution around mining drills.
  Scripting:
    - Added `vector.lua` and `table_extras.lua` for vector and table operations respectively.
    - Added `SurfaceProxy`, accessible from `environment.lua`.
      `SurfaceProxy` is used to keep track of entities created in different contexts.
      Can be created with `environment.surface()`
    - Added functions in `environment.lua` to manage items and fluids.
      `environment.create_supplier()` creates a loader and an infinity chest with the specified filter configuration.
      `environment.create_consumer()` creates a loader and an infinity chest that sinks the incoming items.
      `environment.connect_pipe()` connects an infinity pipe to the specified connection point and adds a fluid filter if needed.
    - Replaced viewport management functions in `environment.lua` with a more comprehensive setup.
      Removed `environment.viewport_height()`, `environment.viewport_width()` and `environment.center_viewport()`.
      Added `environment.configure_viewport()`, which accepts the required width, height, camera position and adjusts the viewport to satisfy them.
      This function returns the new viewport parameters, as well as its precise and rounded bounding boxes.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed pumpjacks using the solid drill simulation.
  Notes:
    - This update doesn't introduce any new simulations, but greatly expands the toolkit.
      Most simulations are designed to be procedurally adjusted for the shown entity,
      and taking every parameter into account is not a simple task.

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 26.11.2024
  Features:
    - Added simulation for roboport.
    - Added simulations for transport belts.
    - Added simulations for underground belts.
    - Added simulations for splitters.
  Scripting:
    - Added `environment.viewport_width(tiles)`.
      Works similarly to `environment.viewport_height(tiles)`, but instead ensures the viewport has the given tiles in width.
    - Added `environment.create_linked_belts(surface, pos1, pos2, direction)`.
      Creates two incredibly fast linked belts, which can be used with any belt type.
    - Added optional second argument to `EventSequence.finish(length, offset)`.
      Delays the execution of the event sequence.
